# Tourism Word Salad#

> ###Clothing is minimal; bodies bronzed and beautiful and the famous Copacabana and Ipanema beaches are a Mecca for Brazilians and tourists alike.

####A collection of sentences I came across while translating content from one language to another using Google Translate.

### Why?

Well because Google Translate can do a great job of translating, it's only a machine so it often fails to see the context of the sentence. So instead of changing the words to keep the sentence more or less the same it finds the closest answer serves it up instead. Some of the results were pretty funny, so I saved a few and made this site to showcase them.

### Word Salad?

Yes, a word salad is an almost incoherent sentence produced by typing too fast and/or not proof-reading. I thought it was a rather fitting term to describe the weird results Google Translate produced. I added "Tourism" to reflect the general context these sentences should be put in.
